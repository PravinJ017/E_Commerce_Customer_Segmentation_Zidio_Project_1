# E-Commerce Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## Project Description
This project aims to segment customers of an e-commerce platform into distinct groups using the K-Means clustering algorithm. By understanding customer behaviors and characteristics, the business can develop targeted marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance overall business performance.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the necessary packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If there is no `requirements.txt` file, the required libraries typically include:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Data
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [specify the source, e.g., a public dataset, internal company data, etc.]. It includes customer information such as:
- Customer ID
- Age
- Gender
- Annual Income
- Spending Score
- [Any other relevant features]

## Feature Engineering
Feature engineering involves transforming raw data into meaningful features that better represent the underlying problem to predictive models. In this project:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Scaling numerical features
- [Any other transformations]

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involves analyzing the dataset to summarize its main characteristics, often with visual methods. Key steps include:
- Univariate analysis (e.g., histograms, box plots)
- Bivariate analysis (e.g., scatter plots, correlation heatmaps)
- Identifying patterns and anomalies

## Modeling
The K-Means clustering algorithm is used to segment customers into distinct groups. Key steps include:
- Determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score
- Applying the K-Means algorithm to the dataset
- Visualizing the clusters

## Evaluation
Evaluating the clustering model involves:
- Analyzing the characteristics of each cluster
- Validating the consistency and distinctness of the clusters
- Using metrics such as Inertia and Silhouette Score

## Results
- Description of identified customer segments
- Key characteristics and behaviors of each segment
- Business insights and potential strategies for each segment

Include visualizations such as:
- Cluster distribution plots
- Feature importance graphs
